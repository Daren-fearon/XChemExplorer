    <H3>Ligand-bound models for Summary</h3>
    <h4>Interpreting 'Ligand confidence'</h4>
    <p><u>4 - High Confidence:</u> The expected ligand was easily interpretable from clear density, and subsequent
        refinement was well-behaved. This ligand can be trusted.
        <br><u>3 - Clear density, unexpected ligand:</u> Density very clearly showed a well-defined ligand, but that
        ligand was unexpected in that crystal/dataset. The observed ligand was modelled anyway, because its presence
        could be explained in some way.
        <br><u>2 - Correct ligand, weak density:</u> Though density was weak, it was possible to model the expected
        ligand, possibly including other circumstantial evidence (e.g. similar ligand in another model).
        <br><u>1 - Low Confidence:</u> The ligand model is to be treated with scepticism, because the evidence (density,
        identity, pose) were not convincing.
    <h4>Interpreting 'Model status':</h4>
    <p><u>6 - Deposited:</u> The model has been deposited in the PDB.
        <br><u>5 - Deposition ready:</u> The model is fully error-free, in every residue, and is ready for deposition.
        <br><u>4 - CompChem ready:</u> The model is complete and correct in the region of the bound ligand. There may be
        remaining small errors elsewhere in the structure, but they are far away and unlikely to be relevant to any
        computational analysis or compound design.
    <h4>Interpreting 'Ligand validation' spider plots:</h4> Each axis represents one of the values described below;
    small is better, and large values on any axis implies that further investigation is warranted.
    <p><u>Quality (RSCC)</u> reflects the fit of the atoms to the experimental density, and should typically be greater
        than 0.7.
        <br><u>Accuracy (RSZD)</u> measures the amount of difference density that is found around these atoms, and
        should be below 3.
        <br><u>B-factor ratio</u> measures the consistency of the model with surrounding protein, and is calculated from
        the B factors of respectively the changed atoms and all side-chain atoms within 4&#8491;. Large values (>3)
        reflect poor evidence for the model, and intermediate values (1.5+) indicate errors in refinement or modelling;
        for weakly-binding ligands, systematically large ratios may be justifiable.
        <br><u>RMSD</u> compares the positions of all atoms built into event density, with their positions after final
        refinement, and should be below 1&#8491;.
        <br><u>Precision (RSZO/OCC)</u> measures how clear the density is after refinement. (This is not a quality
        indicator, but is related to strength of binding but not in a straightforward way.)
